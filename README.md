# GBM-Hg-ISO-EPME
A global box model of Hg isotopes for the EPME
Overview: This package includes MatLab code files that are used for the simulation of glboal Hg isotope dynamic arcoss the end-Permian mass extinction
Hardware requirements: This package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations. Software requirements: The package has been tested on the software MatLab (R2016b, MathWorks) in Windows 10 system.
